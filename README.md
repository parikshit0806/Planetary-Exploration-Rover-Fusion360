## Project Overview

This repository showcases the design and development of a **Planetary Exploration Rover**, meticulously modeled in **Autodesk Fusion 360**. Developed by a multidisciplinary team of Aerospace and Mechatronics Engineering students, this project demonstrates advanced CAD capabilities, complex mechanical system integration, and a thoughtful approach to designing for challenging extraterrestrial environments.

Our primary goal was to create a robust and agile rover capable of navigating uneven planetary terrains while accommodating essential scientific payloads and internal electronics.

## Key Features & Innovations

This rover design incorporates several critical engineering solutions:

1.  **Advanced Rocker-Bogie Suspension System:**
    * A passively articulating 6-wheeled suspension system, inspired by NASA's Mars rovers.
    * Designed for exceptional stability and obstacle negotiation (up to twice the wheel diameter).
    * Includes a **differential ** mechanism integrated between the rocker and the chassis for enhanced stability and dampening.

2.  **Integrated Scientific Payload (Robotic Arm):**
    * A multi-degree-of-freedom robotic arm designed for sample collection, in-situ analysis, or manipulation tasks.
    * Modeled with precise joints to demonstrate realistic articulation.
3.  **Modular & Collaborative Design:**
    * Leveraged Fusion 360's component-based architecture for modular design, enabling parallel work and efficient assembly.
    * Utilized Fusion 360's cloud collaboration features for seamless team coordination and version control.

## Visual Showcase

## Project Files Included

This repository contains the following key files:

* `Planetary_Rover_Project.f3d`: The complete Autodesk Fusion 360 archive file. This is the primary CAD model, containing all components, assemblies, sketches, and design history.

## How to View the Project

To fully explore this project:

1.  **Download Fusion 360:** If you don't have it, you can get a free student license from the [Autodesk website](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-educators).
2.  **Download the `.f3d` file:** Download the `Planetary_Rover_Project.f3d` file from this repository.
3.  **Open in Fusion 360:** In Fusion 360, go to `File > Upload` and select the downloaded `.f3d` file. This will import the entire project into your Fusion 360 Data Panel, allowing you to inspect the design, timeline, joints, and even create your own renders or simulations.
